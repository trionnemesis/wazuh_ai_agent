"""Typed models for every artefact that crosses a layer boundary.

Input contracts (Scenario, Target, Evidence) are authored as hand-written JSON
Schema under ``schemas/`` because humans write that YAML by hand and need good
validation errors. Output contracts (Run, Verdict, Finding) live here as Pydantic
models and their JSON Schema is *generated* (``make schemas``) so the two can
never drift apart.
