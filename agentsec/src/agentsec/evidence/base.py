    Recorded evidence carries the wall-clock time of the day it was captured.
    Latency assertions (``within_seconds``) compare against the *current* run's
    window, so an unshifted fixture either rots the moment the clock passes its
    timestamps or fails whenever the deadline is tighter than the gap between
    then and now — in both cases reporting a detection gap that is really a
    calendar artefact.

    Relative offsets are preserved, so an alert recorded three seconds after the

    (fixture) collection rebases; live backends already query the real window.
