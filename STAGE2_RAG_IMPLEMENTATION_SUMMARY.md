# Stage 2: Core RAG Implementation - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## üéØ Overview
Successfully implemented the core Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) functionality for the Wazuh AI Agent. The system now leverages historical context from similar past alerts to provide more informed and context-aware security analysis.

## üîß Key Components Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Retrieval Module (`find_similar_alerts`)
```python
async def find_similar_alerts(query_vector: List[float], k: int = 5) -> List[Dict[Any, Any]]
```

**Features:**
- Performs k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) searches on OpenSearch using cosine similarity
- Targets the `alert_vector` field in `wazuh-alerts-*` indices
- Filters to only retrieve alerts that have been previously analyzed (`ai_analysis` field exists)
- Returns top k most similar historical alert documents
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

**Search Query Structure:**
- Uses OpenSearch `knn` query with cosine similarity
- Implements Boolean filtering for analyzed alerts only
- Optimized `_source` field selection for performance

### 2. ‚úÖ Enhanced Prompt Template
```python
prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    """You are a senior security analyst. Analyze the new Wazuh alert below, using the provided historical context from similar past alerts to inform your assessment.

    **Relevant Historical Alerts:**
    {historical_context}

    **New Wazuh Alert to Analyze:**
    {alert_summary}

    **Your Analysis Task:**
    1. Briefly summarize the new event.
    2. Assess its risk level (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational), considering any patterns from the historical context.
    3. Provide a clear, context-aware recommendation that references relevant patterns from similar past alerts.

    **Your Triage Report:**
    """
)
```

**Improvements:**
- Clear separation between historical context and new alert data
- Structured task instructions for consistent analysis quality
- Context-aware recommendation requirements

### 3. ‚úÖ Context Formatting Function (`format_historical_context`)
```python
def format_historical_context(alerts: List[Dict[Any, Any]]) -> str
```

**Features:**
- Formats retrieved historical alerts into human-readable context
- Includes key information: timestamp, host, rule details, previous AI analysis
- Truncates long analyses to maintain prompt efficiency
- Includes similarity scores for transparency
- Handles empty result sets gracefully

### 4. ‚úÖ Integrated RAG Workflow (`process_single_alert`)

**Complete Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Alert Preparation:** Extract alert summary and metadata
2. **Vectorization:** Convert alert content to embeddings using `embed_alert_content`
3. **Retrieval:** Find k=5 most similar historical alerts
4. **Context Formatting:** Structure historical data for LLM consumption
5. **LLM Analysis:** Generate context-aware analysis report
6. **Data Persistence:** Store results and vectors in OpenSearch

**Enhanced Data Structure:**
```python
update_body = {
    "doc": {
        "ai_analysis": {
            "triage_report": analysis_result,
            "provider": LLM_PROVIDER,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "similar_alerts_count": len(similar_alerts)
        },
        "alert_vector": alert_vector
    }
}
```

### 5. ‚úÖ OpenSearch Template Configuration
**Vector Field Mapping:**
```python
"alert_vector": {
    "type": "dense_vector",
    "dims": 768,
    "index": True,
    "similarity": "cosine",
    "index_options": {
        "type": "hnsw",
        "m": 16,
        "ef_construction": 512
    }
}
```

**Performance Optimizations:**
- HNSW algorithm for efficient vector search
- Cosine similarity for semantic matching
- Optimized indexing parameters (m=16, ef_construction=512)

## üìä Acceptance Criteria - ACHIEVED ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Logging and Monitoring
- **k-NN Query Logging:** Every vector search operation is logged with query details
- **Similar Alerts Count:** Number of retrieved historical alerts is logged and stored
- **Processing Pipeline:** Each step in the RAG workflow is logged for debugging

**Example Log Output:**
```
INFO - Executing k-NN search for 5 similar alerts
INFO - Found 3 similar historical alerts
INFO - Generating AI analysis for alert_123 with historical context
INFO - Successfully updated alert alert_123 with RAG-enhanced analysis
```

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Analysis Quality
The LLM now generates **context-aware reports** that explicitly reference historical patterns:

**Before RAG (Basic Analysis):**
> "SSH login failed on server01"

**After RAG (Context-Enhanced Analysis):**
> "This SSH login failure on server01 represents the third failed attempt from IP 192.168.1.100 in the last hour, based on similar historical alerts. This pattern indicates a potential brute-force attack. Previous analyses show this IP has been involved in similar attack patterns. Recommend immediate IP blocking and user account monitoring."

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

### Main Triage Function Updates
```python
async def triage_new_alerts():
    """Stage 2: RAG-enhanced alert processing"""
    # 1. Ensure vector index template exists
    await ensure_index_template()
    
    # 2. Query unanalyzed alerts
    alerts = await query_new_alerts(limit=10)
    
    # 3. Process each alert through RAG pipeline
    for alert in alerts:
        await process_single_alert(alert)  # RAG-enhanced processing
```

### Error Handling and Resilience
- **Graceful Degradation:** If vector search fails, processing continues with basic analysis
- **Individual Alert Processing:** Failure in one alert doesn't stop batch processing
- **Comprehensive Exception Logging:** All errors are captured with full stack traces

## üìà Performance Characteristics

### Vector Search Efficiency
- **Index Type:** HNSW for sub-linear search performance
- **Similarity Metric:** Cosine similarity for semantic relevance
- **Search Scope:** Limited to 5 most similar alerts for optimal performance

### Memory and Processing
- **Vector Dimensions:** 768-dimensional embeddings (Gemini text-embedding-004)
- **Source Field Selection:** Only necessary fields retrieved to minimize network overhead
- **Batch Processing:** Up to 10 alerts processed per triage cycle

## üõ† Technical Improvements Made

### Code Quality Enhancements
1. **Consistent Field Naming:** Standardized on `alert_vector` throughout the codebase
2. **Proper Import Management:** Added missing `datetime` import
3. **Logging Standardization:** Consistent use of `logger` instead of mixed `logging`/`print`
4. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages

### Data Consistency
1. **Vector Field Standardization:** All vector operations use `alert_vector` field
2. **Timestamp Handling:** Consistent datetime formatting for analysis timestamps
3. **Source Field Optimization:** Only retrieve necessary fields for context building

## üéØ Key Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Historical Context Integration**
- AI analyses now reference patterns from similar past events
- Improved detection of recurring threats and attack patterns
- Enhanced situational awareness for security analysts

### 2. **Scalable Vector Search**

- Cosine similarity ensures semantically relevant historical matches
- HNSW indexing provides sub-linear search performance

### 3. **Enhanced Analysis Quality**
