# Stage 3: Agentic Context Correlation Implementation

## Executive Summary

The Stage 3 implementation successfully transforms our RAG system into a sophisticated **Agentic AI** system that autonomously decides what contextual information is needed based on alert content and proactively retrieves multi-source data for comprehensive analysis.

## üéØ Core Achievements

### ‚úÖ **Autonomous Decision Engine**
The `determine_contextual_queries()` function implements human-like reasoning logic that:
- Analyzes alert content, rule groups, and severity levels
- Dynamically determines what additional context is needed
- Generates specific query specifications for each data source
- Prioritizes queries based on relevance and importance

### ‚úÖ **Multi-Source Data Retrieval**
The enhanced `execute_retrieval()` function:
- Executes both vector similarity searches and keyword/time-range searches
- Correlates data from 10+ different contextual sources
- Prioritizes high-importance queries for optimal performance
- Aggregates results into structured context objects

### ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Context Correlation**
The system now correlates:
- **Security events** with system performance metrics
- **Resource alerts** with process and memory data
- **SSH events** with brute force patterns and system load
- **Web attacks** with server performance and access logs
- **File system events** with disk usage and process activity

## üöÄ Enhanced Agentic Workflow

### 1. **Intelligent Alert Analysis**
```
ü§ñ AGENTIC DECISION ENGINE: Analyzing alert for contextual needs
   Alert: high cpu usage detected
   Level: 8, Host: web-server-01
   Groups: ['system', 'performance']
```

### 2. **Dynamic Query Generation**
```
‚úÖ DECISION: Adding vector similarity search (always required)
üîç DECISION: Resource-related alert detected - correlating with system data
   ‚úÖ Added process and memory correlation queries
üéØ AGENTIC DECISION COMPLETE: Generated 4 contextual queries
   High priority: 2, Total sources: 4
```

### 3. **Prioritized Multi-Source Retrieval**
```
üîÑ EXECUTING RETRIEVAL: Processing 4 contextual queries
   [1/4] üîç HIGH: Similar historical alerts
      ‚úÖ Found 5 similar alerts
   [2/4] üîç HIGH: Process information from same host
      ‚úÖ Found 8 contextual records
   [3/4] üîç MEDIUM: Memory usage metrics
      ‚úÖ Found 3 contextual records
üìä RETRIEVAL SUMMARY: 16 total contextual records
```

### 4. **Comprehensive LLM Analysis**
The LLM receives enriched context including:
- **Historical Similar Alerts** with previous risk assessments
- **System Metrics** correlated by time and host
- **Process Information** showing resource consumption
- **Network Data** with source/destination details
- **Additional Context** from specialized sources

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### **Decision Engine Logic**

#### Resource-Related Alerts
- **Triggers**: Keywords like "high cpu", "memory leak", "system overload"
- **Context Added**: Process lists, memory metrics, CPU utilization
- **Time Window**: 10-15 minutes for resource pattern analysis

#### Security Events
- **Triggers**: High severity (‚â•7), security keywords, attack groups
- **Context Added**: CPU spikes, network traffic, user activity
- **Time Window**: 1-3 minutes for precise attack correlation

#### SSH-Specific Correlation
- **Triggers**: SSH-related alerts, authentication failures
- **Context Added**: Connection patterns, failure sequences, brute force indicators
- **Enhanced**: Detects and correlates brute force patterns automatically

#### Web Attack Correlation
- **Triggers**: Web-related keywords, HTTP attacks
- **Context Added**: Server performance, access logs, response times
- **Benefits**: Correlates attack impact with server health

### **Enhanced Vector Search**
- Increased similarity search from k=5 to k=7 for better context
- Added data fields to source retrieval for richer analysis
- Improved scoring and relevance ranking

### **Advanced Keyword Search**
- Flexible "should" queries for better matching
- Enhanced field boosting (rule.description^2)
- Fuzzy matching with AUTO fuzziness
- Dual sorting by timestamp and relevance score

## üìä Acceptance Criteria Verification

### ‚úÖ **High CPU Usage Alert Processing**
**Requirement**: When a "High CPU usage" alert is processed, logs must show k-NN search AND keyword search for process lists.

**Implementation**:
```
üîç DECISION: Resource-related alert detected - correlating with system data
‚úÖ DECISION: Adding vector similarity search (always required)
   ‚úÖ Added process and memory correlation queries
```

### ‚úÖ **SSH Authentication Failed Correlation**
**Requirement**: SSH alerts must include similar alerts AND system metrics (CPU, network I/O) in LLM prompt.

**Implementation**:
```
üõ°Ô∏è DECISION: Security event detected - adding comprehensive correlation
üîë DECISION: SSH-related alert - adding SSH-specific correlation
   ‚úÖ Added security event correlation queries (CPU, Network, User)
   ‚úÖ Added SSH brute force correlation
```

### ‚úÖ **Comprehensive LLM Analysis**
**Requirement**: LLM output must demonstrate clear synthesis of correlated data.

**Enhanced Prompt Template**:
```
**Historical Similar Alerts:**
{similar_alerts_context}

**Correlated System Metrics:**
{system_metrics_context}

**Process Information:**
{process_context}

**Network Data:**
{network_context}

**Additional Context:**
{additional_context}
```

**Example Expected Output**:
*"The SSH login attempt coincides with a 95% CPU spike and a surge in network traffic on port 22, strongly suggesting this was a resource-intensive brute-force attack, not just a simple failed login."*

## üö® Real-World Correlation Examples

### **SSH Brute Force Attack**
1. **Alert**: "SSH authentication failed"
2. **Agent Decision**: Security event + SSH-specific correlation
3. **Context Retrieved**:
   - Similar SSH attacks from last 30 days
   - CPU metrics showing 95% spike during attack window
   - Network logs showing 50+ connection attempts from same IP
   - SSH failure patterns over 10-minute window
4. **LLM Analysis**: Correlates all sources to identify coordinated attack

### **Web Server Resource Exhaustion**
1. **Alert**: "High CPU usage detected"
2. **Agent Decision**: Resource + Web correlation (if web server)
3. **Context Retrieved**:
   - Process lists showing Apache processes consuming 90% CPU
